    <h1 widght="30%">Padma bridge</h1>
    <P>The Padma Bridge is a multi-purpose road and rail bridge over the Padma River in Bangladesh. It is the longest bridge in Bangladesh and the deepest-piled bridge in the world. Its construction began on 7 December 2014 by China Railway Major Bridge Engineering Company Limited and was completed in May 2022. The double-decker bridge constructed of steel and concrete has a length of 6.15 km and a width of 18.10 m. It has a four-lane highway on its upper deck and a single-track railway below. Also, power lines, gas pipes, and fiber optic cables are carried through the bridge. 30,193 crore 39 lakh taka ($3.56 billion) has been spent on the entire project. Padma River is one of the most rapid and erosive rivers in the world. Therefore, building a bridge over this river was a very difficult task. Unfortunately, international lending banks, including the World Bank, suspended lending due to allegations of corruption. Finally, the Bangladesh government undertook the construction of the Padma Bridge with its own funding and successfully completed it. The bridge connects the southwestern part of the country with the capital and the northeastern region. It has made travel and transportation easier and faster. Not only the 21 districts of the southwestern region, but the people of the entire country are benefiting from the Padma Bridge in many ways. The market for agricultural products is expanding. Now farmers are able to reach Dhaka quickly with grains, fruits, and vegetables. The income of the people of the southern region has increased. Economic zones, hi-tech parks, and industrial factories have started to develop on both sides of the bridge. New investment and employment opportunities are being created. In the coming days, the Padma multi-purpose bridge will continue to promote industrial development and economic growth in Bangladesh.
